# Module Project: Component Lifecycle Methods - React Github User Card

> Completed during my first month of React training

This project allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned in this module and apply them in a concrete project. This module explored lifecycle methods in class components. In your project you will demonstrate proficiency of these concepts by recreating the Github User Card project, but as a React application this time.

## Features

- Utilizes componentDidMount() to populate the user card with my own GitHub info and followers
- Ability to click on a follower to load their information into the user card
- Ability to search for a user by username to load their info into user card
